      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm a unlikely paralegal finally following his true passions in life!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Brownsville, Texas</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p><ul>
        <li>Gaming - League of Legends Mainly</li>
        <li>Reading - Harry Potter is Life</li>
        <li>Going to random venues to hear unknown bands.</li>
        </ul> </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I love the Ocean and always wanted to be a Marine Biologist.
        However, I could never actually get myself into Biolgy. So, my dream job would be to be a game dev for my own passion projects.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In my hometown, Good 'ol South Texas!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>For the reason everyone else wants but won't admit... THE PAYDAY!
        I kid, while of course that is a part of it I just have wanted to learn code for years.
        I never did becuase I was never brave enought to follow my own path. I like solving puzzles and getting annoyed when I can't solve a puzzle only to realize it was a simple answer.
        It's just fun. Or so it seems. I want to be a web deve becuase I know it'll finally help me be where I've always wanted to be.
